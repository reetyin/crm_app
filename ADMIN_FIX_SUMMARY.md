# CRM Admin Interface Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Asset Pipeline Error
**Problem**: `Propshaft::MissingAssetError` - The asset 'active_admin_custom.scss.css' was not found
**Solution**: 
- Removed the custom stylesheet registration from `config/initializers/active_admin.rb`
- Deleted the problematic `active_admin_custom.scss` file
- Using default ActiveAdmin styles instead

### 2. UTF-8 Encoding Configuration
**Problem**: Potential encoding issues with non-ASCII characters
**Solution**:
- Added proper UTF-8 CSV export configuration in ActiveAdmin
- Set `config.csv_options` with UTF-8 encoding
- Added English locale enforcement
- Configured proper charset handling

### 3. ActiveStorage Image Display
**Problem**: `ActiveRecord::InverseOfAssociationNotFoundError` with image attachments
**Solution**:
- Updated image display logic in `app/admin/customers.rb`
- Added proper error handling for image display
- Removed problematic `url_for` calls that were causing association errors

### 4. Chinese Text Removal
**Problem**: Request to remove all Chinese text from code and comments
**Solution**:
- Updated `config/routes.rb` to use English comments
- Changed ActiveAdmin site title to "CRM Admin Panel"
- Ensured all code comments are in English
